<br>
REDHAT UNIVERSAL BASE IMAGE v 7.6 (Maipo)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<br>
RED HAT UNIVERSAL BASE IMAGE<br>
<br>
PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY 
BEFORE USING SOFTWARE FROM RED HAT. BY USING RED HAT SOFTWARE, YOU 
SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS END USER LICENSE 
AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS. AN 
INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS 
THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ON 
BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE THE RED HAT SOFTWARE. THIS END USER 
LICENSE AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY RIGHTS TO RED HAT SERVICES 
SUCH AS SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT. PLEASE REVIEW 
YOUR SERVICE OR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT(S) THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH 
RED HAT OR OTHER AUTHORIZED RED HAT SERVICE PROVIDERS REGARDING 
SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED PAYMENTS. <br>
<br>
This end user license agreement ("EULA") governs the use of 
Red Hat Universal Base Image and associated software supporting 
such container(s) and any related updates, source code, 
including the appearance, structure and organization (the 
"Programs"), regardless of the delivery mechanism. If a Red Hat 
Universal Base Image is included in another Red Hat product, the EULA 
terms of such other Red Hat product will apply and supersede this 
EULA. If a Red Hat Universal Base Image is included in a third 
party work, the terms of this EULA will continue to govern the 
Red Hat Universal Base Image. <br>
<br>
1. License Grant. Subject to the terms of this EULA, Red 
Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") grants to you a perpetual, worldwide 
license to the Programs (each of which may include multiple 
software components). With the exception of the Red Hat trademark 
identified in Section 2 below, each software component is governed by 
a license that permits you to run, copy, modify, and 
redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the software 
components. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not 
limit your rights under, or grant you rights that supersede, the 
license terms applicable to any particular component. The license 
terms applicable to each software component are provided in the 
source code of that component. <br>
<br>
2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of 
their components are owned by Red Hat and other licensors and are 
protected under copyright law and other laws as applicable. Title to 
the Programs and any component shall remain with Red Hat and 
other licensors, subject to the applicable license, excluding any 
independently developed and licensed work. The "Red Hat" trademark is a 
registered trademark of Red Hat and its affiliates in the U.S. and 
other countries. Subject to Red Hat's trademark usage guidelines 
(set forth at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/), 
this EULA permits you to distribute the Programs that include 
the Red Hat trademark, provided you do not make any statements 
on behalf of Red Hat, including but not limited to, stating or 
in any way suggesting (in any public, private and/or 
confidential statement (whether written or verbal)) that Red Hat 
supports or endorses software built and delivered with a Red Hat 
Universal Base Image(s) (such derivative works referred to as a "Red 
Hat Based Container Images"); provided if a Red Hat Based 
Container Image is Red Hat Certified and deployed on a Red Hat 
supported configuration as set forth at https://access.redhat.
com/articles/2726611 then you may state that the Red Hat Universal Base Image is 
supported by Red Hat. You agree to include this unmodified EULA in 
all distributions of container images sourced, built or 
otherwise derived from the Programs. If you modify the Red Hat 
Universal Base Image(s), you must remove any Red Hat trademark(s) 
prior to any subsequent distribution. Any breach of this Section 
2 is a material breach of the EULA and you may no longer use 
and/or distribute the Red Hat trademark(s). Modifications to the 
software may corrupt the Programs. <br>
<br>
3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this 
Section 3, a separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a 
particular component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable 
law, the Programs and the components are provided and licensed 
"as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, 
including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement 
or fitness for a particular purpose. Neither Red Hat nor its 
affiliates warrant that the functions contained in the Programs will 
meet your requirements or that the operation of the Programs 
will be entirely error free, appear or perform precisely as 
described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with 
regulatory requirements. Red Hat warrants that the media on which the 
Programs and the components are provided will be free from defects 
in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 
30 days from the date of delivery to you. This warranty 
extends only to the party that purchases subscription services for 
the supported configurations from Red Hat and/or its affiliates 
or a Red Hat authorized distributor. <br>
<br>
4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, your exclusive remedy under 
this EULA is to return any defective media within 30 days of 
delivery along with a copy of your payment receipt and Red Hat, at 
its option, will replace it or refund the money you paid for 
the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable 
law, under no circumstances will Red Hat, its affiliates, any 
Red Hat authorized distributor, or the licensor of any 
component provided to you under this EULA be liable to you for any 
incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost 
savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or 
any component, even if Red Hat, its affiliates, an authorized 
distributor, and/or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages. In no event shall Red Hat's or its affiliates' liability, 
an authorized distributor's liability or the liability of the 
licensor of a component provided to you under this EULA exceed the 
amount that you paid to Red Hat for the media under this EULA. <br>
<br>
5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United 
States and other countries, you represent and warrant that you: 
(a) understand that the Programs and their components may be 
subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department's 
Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) are not located in 
a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. 
sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, 
Syria, and the Crimea Region of Ukraine, subject to change as 
posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-
export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination, 
persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security 
Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign 
Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without 
the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will 
not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any 
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or 
military end-uses where prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, 
unless authorized by the relevant government agency by regulation 
or specific license; (e) understand and agree that if you are 
in the United States and export or transfer the Programs to 
eligible end users, you will, to the extent required by EAR Section 
740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to Red Hat Universal Base 
Image End User License Agreement Page 2 of 2 April, 2019 the 
Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which include 
the name and address (including country) of each transferee; 
and (f) understand that countries including the United States 
may restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products 
(which may include the Programs and the components) and agree that 
you shall be solely responsible for compliance with any such 
import, use, or export restrictions. <br>
<br>
6. Third Party Software. The Program may be provided with 
third party software programs subject to their own license terms. 
The license terms either accompany the third party software 
programs or, in some instances, may be viewed at registry.access.
redhat.com. If you do not agree to abide by the applicable license 
terms for the third party software programs, then you may not 
install, distribute or use them. <br>
<br>
7. General. If any provision of this EULA is held to be 
unenforceable, the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be 
affected. Any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or relating 
to this EULA shall be governed by the laws of the State of New 
York and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of 
laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties to 
this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention 
on the International Sale of Goods. <br>
